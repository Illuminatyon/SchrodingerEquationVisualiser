# Suppressing "missing ScriptRunContext" Warnings

## Issue Description

When running the Schr√∂dinger Equation Solver Streamlit application, you may see multiple warnings like this:

```
Thread 'MainThread': missing ScriptRunContext! This warning can be ignored when running in bare mode.
```

These warnings are generated by Streamlit's internal code and are not related to the functionality of the application. As the message itself states, these warnings can be safely ignored when running in "bare mode."

## Why This Happens

The "missing ScriptRunContext" warning occurs when Streamlit is trying to access its script context but can't find it. This typically happens in certain execution environments or when Streamlit is run in a non-standard way.

These warnings do not affect the functionality of the application and can be safely ignored. However, they can be annoying as they clutter the console output.

## Solutions

We've provided two different ways to suppress these warnings:

### Option 1: Windows Batch File (Simplest for Windows Users)

We've created a batch file that runs Streamlit and filters out these specific warnings from the output:

```
run_streamlit_with_filter.bat
```

To use it:
1. Open a command prompt in the project directory
2. Run the batch file:
   ```
   run_streamlit_with_filter.bat
   ```

This will start the Streamlit application normally but filter out the "missing ScriptRunContext" warnings from the console output.

### Option 2: Python Wrapper Script (Cross-Platform)

We've also created a Python script that configures the logging system to filter out these warnings before launching Streamlit:

```
run_streamlit.py
```

To use it:
1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python run_streamlit.py
   ```

This script will:
- Configure Python's logging system to filter out the specific warnings
- Launch the Streamlit application with the same functionality
- Pass through any command-line arguments you provide

For example, to run with a specific port:
```
python run_streamlit.py --server.port 8502
```

## Which Option Should I Use?

- If you're on Windows and want the simplest solution, use Option 1 (the batch file).
- If you're on macOS or Linux, or if you need to pass custom arguments to Streamlit, use Option 2 (the Python script).

## Note

These warnings are harmless and don't affect the functionality of the application. If you don't mind seeing them in the console, you can continue to run the application directly with:

```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The solutions provided here are simply for a cleaner console output experience.
