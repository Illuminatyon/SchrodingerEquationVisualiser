# Image Descriptions for README Files

This file contains descriptions of the images that should be included in the README files to showcase the capabilities of the Schr√∂dinger Equation Solver application.

## 1. 1D Visualization Example

**Filename:** 1d_visualization.png

**Description:** A screenshot showing the 1D visualization of eigenstates and potential for a harmonic oscillator. The image should display multiple energy levels with their corresponding wave functions, and the potential curve.

## 2. 2D Visualization Example

**Filename:** 2d_visualization.png

**Description:** A screenshot showing the 2D visualization of eigenstates for a 2D infinite well or harmonic oscillator. The image should display contour plots or surface plots of the probability density for different energy levels.

## 3. Time Evolution Animation

**Filename:** time_evolution.gif

**Description:** An animated GIF showing the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet in a potential well. The animation should demonstrate how the wave packet spreads and reflects from the boundaries over time.

## 4. Spectrum Analysis

**Filename:** spectrum_analysis.png

**Description:** A visualization of the energy eigenvalues (spectrum) for a specific potential, showing the distribution of energy levels and possibly their degeneracy.

## 5. 3D Surface Plot

**Filename:** 3d_surface.png

**Description:** A 3D surface plot of a 2D potential function, such as the 2D harmonic oscillator or circular well, showing the shape of the potential energy surface.

## 6. Probability Density Comparison

**Filename:** probability_density.png

**Description:** A comparison of probability densities for different eigenstates, showing how the probability of finding the particle varies with position for different energy levels.

## Placement in README Files

These images should be distributed throughout the README files to illustrate different aspects of the application:

1. Main README.md: Include a selection of these images to give an overview of the application's capabilities.
2. Language-specific README files: Include the same images with translated captions to maintain consistency across all documentation.
