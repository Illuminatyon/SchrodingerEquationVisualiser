# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the README files to showcase the capabilities of the Schr√∂dinger Equation Solver application.

## Required Images

The following images should be added to this directory:

1. **1d_visualization.png** - A screenshot showing the 1D visualization of eigenstates and potential for a harmonic oscillator.

2. **2d_visualization.png** - A screenshot showing the 2D visualization of eigenstates for a 2D infinite well or harmonic oscillator.

3. **time_evolution.gif** - An animated GIF showing the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet in a potential well.

4. **spectrum_analysis.png** - A visualization of the energy eigenvalues (spectrum) for a specific potential.

5. **3d_surface.png** - A 3D surface plot of a 2D potential function.

## How to Generate These Images

These images can be generated by running the application and taking screenshots or recordings of the visualizations. Here's how to generate each type of image:

1. **1D Visualization**: Run the application, select dimension 1D, choose a potential (e.g., Harmonic Oscillator), and take a screenshot of the eigenstates and potential plot.

2. **2D Visualization**: Run the application, select dimension 2D, choose a potential (e.g., Infinite Well), and take a screenshot of the eigenstate contour plots.

3. **Time Evolution**: Run the application, enable time evolution animation, and record a GIF of the animation.

4. **Spectrum Analysis**: Run the application and take a screenshot of the energy eigenvalues table or create a bar chart visualization of the eigenvalues.

5. **3D Surface Plot**: Run the application in 2D mode and take a screenshot of the 3D surface plot of the potential.

Once these images are generated, place them in this directory to replace the placeholders in the README files.
