# Resolving Display Issues with the Schrödinger Solver Streamlit App

## Issue Description

The Streamlit application for the Schrödinger equation solver is not displaying any content when launched. This document provides tools and instructions to diagnose and resolve this issue.

## Possible Causes

There are several potential reasons why nothing is displayed in the Streamlit application:

1. **Streamlit Installation Issues**: Streamlit might not be correctly installed or might be an incompatible version.
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Some required packages might be missing or have incompatible versions.
3. **Browser Compatibility**: The browser might have settings that prevent Streamlit from displaying correctly.
4. **Network/Firewall Issues**: Firewall settings might be blocking the Streamlit server.
5. **Python Path Issues**: The `schrodinger_solver` package might not be in the Python path.
6. **Resource Limitations**: The calculations might be too resource-intensive for your system.

## Diagnostic Tools

Three diagnostic tools have been created to help you resolve this issue:

1. **`test_streamlit_app.py`**: A minimal Streamlit app to test if Streamlit works in general.
2. **`check_dependencies.py`**: A script to verify that all required dependencies are correctly installed.
3. **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**: A comprehensive guide with step-by-step troubleshooting instructions.

## How to Use These Tools

### Step 1: Check Dependencies

Run the dependency checking script to verify that all required packages are correctly installed:

```bash
python check_dependencies.py
```

This script will check:
- Your Python version
- Required packages and their versions
- The `schrodinger_solver` package and its modules

If any issues are found, follow the instructions provided by the script to install the missing dependencies.

### Step 2: Test Streamlit

Run the minimal Streamlit test app to check if Streamlit works in general:

```bash
streamlit run test_streamlit_app.py
```

If this test app displays correctly, Streamlit is working properly, and the issue is specific to the Schrödinger solver application.

### Step 3: Follow the Troubleshooting Guide

Refer to the `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` file for a comprehensive guide to resolving display issues:

```bash
# Open the troubleshooting guide in your text editor or browser
```

The guide provides step-by-step instructions for:
- Verifying Streamlit installation
- Checking browser compatibility
- Testing network access
- Running with verbose logging
- And more...

### Step 4: Run the Main Application with Simplified Parameters

If the test app works but the main app still doesn't display, try running the main app with simplified parameters:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

In the interface, try:
- Selecting 1D instead of 2D
- Reducing the number of grid points
- Choosing a simpler potential like "Harmonic Oscillator"

## Common Solutions

Here are some common solutions that have resolved this issue for other users:

1. **Reinstall Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear your browser's cache or try a different browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).

3. **Run on a Different Port**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
   ```

4. **Create a New Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv new_venv
   new_venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Update Streamlit**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade streamlit
   ```

## Need Further Assistance?

If you've tried all the steps above and are still experiencing issues, please:

1. Run the application with debug logging:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py --logger.level=debug
   ```

2. Note any error messages that appear in the terminal.

3. Check your browser's developer console (F12) for any JavaScript errors.
