- Designed card-like sections with hover animations

### 4. Custom Visualization Styling

- Implemented consistent styling for all plots and visualizations
- Added custom colormaps that complement the application's color scheme

   - Added CSS via `st.markdown()` with `unsafe_allow_html=True`
   - Implemented animations using CSS keyframes
   - Created responsive layouts with flexbox

3. **Custom Matplotlib Styling**:
   - Created a custom styling module (`custom_mpl_style.py`)
   - Applied consistent styling to all visualizations

4. **HTML/CSS for Enhanced Components**:
   - Designed custom components using HTML and CSS
   - Implemented animations and transitions

## Results

The application now features:
